Concept
=======
Analyze the change in the use of print from Python 2.6 to Python 3.0. Print was changed from a statement to a function,
forcing more complicated changes in syntax in order to uphold the different capabilities a function has compared to a statement.
We aim to look at the reasons behind this change and see how this change was viewed in the community.
